Requsets when using:
if you use VScode, please open two VScode window, one for open Client, one for Sever ,this is important ,or system can't find client's file.

homework requests:
1.because when I finish one parse code ,I will submit and write introduction ,so I don't write Code comments.
2.client1 is used for downloading 1 file.
3.client2 is used for multiple clients can download files at the same time ,so when you run client1 ,please run client2 too.
4.client3 is used for downloading multiple files.
5.I use retry and test whether the lendth is equal to correct lendth for correctly download 1 file despite losses ,if losses ,will downloading again and again.

suggestion:
I restrict 15 seconds for sever ,if there is no requests form client, then it will exit , if you think the time is short ,you can change it.
